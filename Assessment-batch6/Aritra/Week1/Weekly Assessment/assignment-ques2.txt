1. we will create a pipeline jenkins under the "create new item"
2. After this, we have to create Jenkinsfile where we will be adding all the executable commansa for the pipeline.
3)	Add this Jenkinsfile to git repository
4)	Choose Poll SCM under build triggers and mention the time for the execution.
5)When we pull the code from git, jenkins will execute the commands written in the Jenkinsfile under the master branch.
6)	Now after saving the configuration, we can click on the build and check the build output.


Jenkins script file:(Jenkinsfile)
