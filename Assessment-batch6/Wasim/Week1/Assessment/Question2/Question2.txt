To create a Jenkins pipeline for Q1,  we have to follow these steps:

1)	Open the jenkins using 'https://http//localhost:8080/'
2)	Login to the jenkins.
3)	Select "Create new Item" and choose a pipeline project
4)	After this, we have to create Jenkinsfile where we will be adding all the executable commansa for the pipeline.
5)	Add this Jenkinsfile to git repository
6)	Choose Poll SCM under build triggers and mention the time for the execution.
7)	We choose pipeline script from SCM.
8)	We will configure the git account credentials.
9)	When we pull the code from git, jenkins will execute the commands written in the Jenkinsfile under the master branch.
10)	Now after saving the configuration, we can click on the build and check the build output.


Jenkins script file:(Jenkinsfile)

	pipeline {
	
		agent any

		stages {
		
			stage ('Initialize') {
				steps {
					bat 'mvn clean install'
				}
			}
			
			stage ('Test') {
				steps {
					bat 'mvn test'
				}
			}
			
			stage ('Package') {
				steps {
					bat 'mvn package'
				}
			}

			stage ('Execute') {
				steps {
					bat 'java -cp target/JavaFirstProject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.sapient.week1'
				}
