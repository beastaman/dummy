Throwable : super class of all the exceptions :
	1) Exception (checked)(super class of all the exceptions):
		Sub classes : Arithmetic, .. etc
	2) Error (Unchecked)
		index out of bound,  division by 0
		
		
Handling: 
	1) should be specific 
	2) should be handled centralised (only one place to handle the errors like main)
	3) by keywords -> try,catch, throw, throws, finally, 
	
	
types of exceptions : 

	1) System defined exceptions : automatically called, no need to throw.
	
	2) user defined  : user can create own exceptions by extending Exception class, notmally we create user defined 
						exceptions to check business rules are voilated or not, user defined exceptions is not called automatically
						we have to throw it.
						

Multiprocessing: 
Multiuser : windows is single user , linux is multi user
Multitasking: : windows multitasking, 
MultiThreading: concurrent programming from same program 

Context switch : one thread stops and execute another thread. (wait, notify, sleep, )
				if not used properly, default setting is round robin algo
						
Threads: 
	1) extending thread super class -> 
		override method run -> when run begins execution, thread will start, thread will end at the run end
		run method should not be called explicitly.
		run method should be called from start method.
