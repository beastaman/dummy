Collections:
	Is a framework in Java, which is made up of interfaces, classes and algorithms.
	In java framework, we have 2 main interfaces: 
	
		1) Collection : (only value use case)
			List : (supports duplicate and are ordered can be accessed using index value)	
				classes : arraylist, vector, linkedlist
			Set : (no duplicate values and are unordered)
				Hashset(no duplicate, unordered),
				treeset(no duplicate , sorted ordered), 
				linkedhashset(no duplicate, ordered as entered by user)
			Queue : (FIFO -->  )
				using linkedlist
			Dequeue : (Both FIFO and LIFO)
				using linkedlist
			
		2) Map (key-value pair) : 
			HashMap: no duplicate, not ordered
			TreeMap: no duplicate, sorted ordered
			LinkedHashMap: no duplicate, ordered
			
			
Design patterns
	1) MVC -- N.W
	2) GOF -- Gang of four
	3) SOLID 
	4) Microservice -- N.N.W
	
	
	GOF->  Creational patterns , Structural patterns, Behavioral patterns
		
		Creational patterns -> creating the objects, 
			factory DP --> onse superclass and multiple sub classes, factory class should return the object of sub class
			Singleton DP
			Abstract FDP
			Builder pattern
			
		Structural patterns -> 
			adapter
			bridge
			composite
			proxy
			
		Behavioral patterns ->
			command
			iterative
			interpreter
