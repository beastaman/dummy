using the localhost and the port that we used during installation, we can use the jenkins network

- create a new pipeline job by going to the create new jobs
- For pipeline Script, SCM has to be choosen( it is to instruct jenkins to obtain pipeline from local git repo)
- choose git
- paste the github link of the repo
- and in the advance tab section, add the github credentials
- and save it

Now the pipeline is created as Jenkinsfile(extention should be .file)

and in pipeline block, agent and stages block were added which tells the compiler to compile using the given commands(for building, testing)

and when we run it, Jerkins starts building our application and tells us how it was compiled(whether our application is working fine or not)
